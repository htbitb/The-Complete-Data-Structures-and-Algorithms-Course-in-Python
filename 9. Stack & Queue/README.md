## STACK 

A **Stack** is a linear data structure that stores items in a [**Last-In/First-Out(LIFO)**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lifo-last-in-first-out-approach-in-programming/). In stack, a new element is added at one end and an element is removed from that end only. The insert and delete operations are often called push and pop

**Basic operation we can do on a stack are:**
* **Push**: Adds a new element on the stack
* **Pop**: Removes and returns the top element from the stack
* **Peek**: Returns the top element on the stack
* **isEmpty**: checks if the stack is empty.
* **Size**: Finds the number of elements in the stack.
  
**Applications**

Stacks can be used to implement undo mechanisms, to revert to previous states, to create algorithms for depth-first search in graphs, or for backtracking.


## Queue

Like a stack, the queue is a linear data structure that stores items in a [**First In First Out**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fifo-first-in-first-out-approach-in-programming/). With a queueu, the least recently added item is removed first. A good example of a queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.

**Basic operations we can do on a queue are**:
* **Enqueue**: Adds a new element to the queue
* **Dequeue**: Removes and returns the first (front) element from the queue.
* **Peek**: Returns the first element in the queue.
* **isEmpty**: Checks if the queue is empty
* **Size**: Finds the number of elements in the queue.

**Application**:
Queues can be used to implement job scheduling for an office printer, order processing for e-tickets, or to create algorithms for breadth-first search in graphs.
